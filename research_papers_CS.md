## Decision Fatigue in Machine Learning

### Article 1 (1 Citation)

**DOI:** [Reducing user fatigue within an interactive evolutionary design system using clustering and case-based reasoning](https://doi.org/10.1080/03052150903081556)

**Summary:** User fatigue is a limiting factor in interactive evolutionary design and optimization systems. This work illustrates how user fatigue arising from repetitive evaluations can be reduced by incorporating a case-based machine learning system and by clustering the population. An interactive evolutionary design system for urban furniture design is introduced and used as a test-bed for the implementation. The role of clustering within the system is described and initial results are presented. Results obtained from previous work supporting the choice of a case-based approach to machine learning are then presented and, finally, the results from a multi-user study of the performance of the case-based learning system when applied to the design of urban furniture are included.

**DOI:** [A Review of User Interface Design for Interactive Machine Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3185517)

**Abstract:** Interactive Machine Learning (IML) seeks to complement human perception and intelligence by tightly integrating these strengths with the computational power and speed of computers. The interactive process is designed to involve input from the user but does not require the background knowledge or experience that might be necessary to work with more traditional machine learning techniques. Under the IML process, non-experts can apply their domain knowledge and insight over otherwise unwieldy datasets to find patterns of interest or develop complex data-driven applications. This process is co-adaptive in nature and relies on careful management of the interaction between human and machine. User interface design is fundamental to the success of this approach, yet there is a lack of consolidated principles on how such an interface should be implemented. This article presents a detailed review and characterisation of Interactive Machine Learning from an interactive systems perspective. We propose and describe a structural and behavioural model of a generalised IML system and identify solution principles for building effective interfaces for IML. Where possible, these emergent solution principles are contextualised by reference to the broader human-computer interaction literature. Finally, we identify strands of user interface research key to unlocking more efficient and productive non-expert interactive machine learning applications.
